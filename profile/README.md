# Carbon-I: A NASA Earth System Explorer mission (in Phase A)

## Mission Overview

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for the Carbon-I NASA Earth System Explorer (ESE) mission. Our mission is dedicated to advancing the understanding of carbon cycles and their impact on Earth's climate system through cutting-edge space-based observations and research.

## Objectives

- **Measure Carbon Emissions:** Utilize advanced satellite technology to accurately measure carbon emissions from various sources across the globe.
- **Enable measurements in the humid tropics:** Current dedicated greenhouse gas satellite failed to provide adequate data coverage in the tropics, Carbon-I will fill this void.
- **Multi-Species retrievals:** By also measuring CO, H<sub>2</sub>O, HDO and potentially ethane, we can attribute sources not only spatially but also chemically.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Satellite Technology:** Leverage state-of-the-art satellite instruments with proven heritage.
- **Open Data Access:** Ensure that all collected data is freely available to the public, promoting transparency and fostering further research.
- **Collaborative Research:** Partner with leading institutions and researchers worldwide to enhance the scope and depth of our studies.
- **Educational Outreach:** Engage with the community through educational initiatives, promoting awareness and understanding of carbon-related climate issues.
